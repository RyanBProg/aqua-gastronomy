# AquaGastronomy

A modern, responsive website built for AquaGastronomy, featuring interactive forms, sleek animations, and a seamless user experience. This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**.

## Features

- **Bookings Page**: Customers can make reservations directly through a form.
- **Contact Page**: A contact form allows visitors to get in touch with the restaurant.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Smooth, elegant animations for menu transitions, pop-ups, and scrolling effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, from mobile to desktop.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and minimalistic design.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, routing, and performance optimization.
- **React**: Component-based architecture for building the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library used to create interactive and smooth animations.
