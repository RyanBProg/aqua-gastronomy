        <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
          AquaGastronomy was founded by world-renowned hydrologist, philosopher,
          and self-proclaimed Water Whisperer, Jean-Pierre Eauclair.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
          Jean-Pierre dedicated his life to studying water in all its states. He
          traveled the globe, from the frozen glaciers of Antarctica to the
          murky depths of the Amazon River, in search of the perfect drop.

        <h2 className="font-semibold">Mastering the Art of H₂O</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
          With his findings, Jean-Pierre returned to civilization and assembled
          a team of like-minded hydro-culinarians—visionaries who shared his
          passion for the art of water. Together, they refined ancient
          techniques of steam infusions, evaporation pairings, and frozen
          aeration.
