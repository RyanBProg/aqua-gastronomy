      <h1 className="font-semibold text-2xl mb-2">Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Welcome to AquaGastronomy. By entering our temple of hydration and
        participating in the sacred act of consuming water, you agree to the
        following terms and conditions. If you do not agree, we kindly suggest
        you hydrate elsewhere.
      </p>
      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">1. Hydration Liability</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        AquaGastronomy assumes no responsibility for your profound enlightenment
        through the consumption of water. Our elixirs may open your mind,
        cleanse your soul, or unlock ancient memories of past aquatic lifetimes.
        Please hydrate responsibly. If you experience sudden epiphanies about
        the meaning of life or spontaneous conversations with ocean deities, we
        recommend deep breaths and slow sips.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">2. Transcendental Sips</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        All drinks served at AquaGastronomy are meticulously crafted to elevate
        your hydration to cosmic levels. However, we cannot guarantee that you
        will reach enlightenment or achieve transcendence on your first visit.
        Spiritual awakening may vary by individual. Some guests may need more
        than one glass of the <em>Sahara Cocktail</em> before fully
        understanding the secrets of the universe.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">
        3. Water-Specific Dietary Restrictions
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Please note that all offerings at AquaGastronomy consist of 100% pure
        water. If you are allergic to water, we kindly request you refrain from
        dining with us. We do not offer substitutes such as air, fire, or earth.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">4. Water Shaman Guidance</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Our Master Water Shaman is trained in the sacred art of aqua-divination.
        By participating in the Water Invocation Ceremony, you agree to let the
        Shaman guide your journey through the realms of hydration. The Water
        Shamanâ€™s chants, movements, and prophetic wisdom are for entertainment
        purposes only. Any predictions about your future, past lives, or spirit
        animal should not be taken as legally binding.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">5. Dress Code</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Please arrive dressed in an attire befitting your journey to water
        enlightenment. Flowing robes, minimalist whites, or clothing inspired by
        aquatic lifeforms are highly encouraged. Footwear that makes the sound
        of rain droplets is optional but appreciated. Guests in excessive thirst
        may be asked to perform a ceremonial rain dance before seating.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">6. Reservations</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Reservations are a must. Due to the ethereal nature of water and its
        connection to the metaphysical realms, seating is extremely limited. We
        will not be held responsible for your frustration if our fluid, flowing
        seating schedule is too abstract for your liking.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">7. Payment Policy</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        At AquaGastronomy, we accept all major currencies, but we highly
        encourage paying with seashells, ancient river stones, or other
        offerings to the Water Spirits. We also accept energetic exchanges such
        as chants, blessings, and positive vibrations. Please note that credit
        cards may be too materialistic for our purposes but will be tolerated.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">
        8. No Refunds on Enlightenment
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Once you have consumed our divine elixirs, refunds will not be provided.
        Enlightenment, hydration, and spiritual fulfillment are subjective
        experiences, and we make no guarantees. If you do not achieve a higher
        state of being, it may be due to your own spiritual blockages or
        improper sip technique.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">9. Disclaimer</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        All references to transcending the material plane, water-based miracles,
        or attaining immortality are for entertainment purposes only.
        AquaGastronomy is not responsible for any shifts in your cosmic
        alignment or sudden desires to live in an underwater kingdom. Please
        consult your nearest oracle or guru before making any life-altering
        decisions based on your experience here.
