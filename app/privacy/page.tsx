        1. Collection of Mystical Waters... and Data
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        At AquaGastronomy, we collect not only the finest waters from ethereal
        springs but also certain personal information to enhance your
        experience. This includes your name, email address, and any vibrations
        you leave in our aura. Rest assured, your data will be handled with the
        same reverence we give to sacred waters.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">2. The Flow of Data</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Just like the water cycle, your data may be shared with third parties,
        including the cloud (both digital and celestial). We may flow your
        information towards necessary services such as booking systems, water
        spirit communicators, and payment gateways, but only to facilitate your
        journey towards hydration enlightenment.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">3. Sacred Cookies</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Our website uses “cookies,” which, contrary to popular belief, are not
        actual baked goods, but small pieces of data stored on your device.
        These cookies help us ensure your experience is as fluid as a mountain
        stream. By visiting AquaGastronomy, you agree to the placement of these
        invisible data droplets. Should you wish to clear your cookies, please
        consult the stars... or your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">4. Spiritual Data Security</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Your data is as sacred to us as the water we serve. We employ digital
        guardians, encryption spells, and ancient protective wards to keep your
        personal information safe from the forces of darkness (and hackers).
        However, even the most powerful enchantments are not infallible, so we
        cannot guarantee absolute security, especially if you’ve angered the
        Water Spirits.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">5. Water and Data Retention</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Just as we bottle and preserve only the purest of waters, we retain your
        personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose. Once
        your journey through AquaGastronomy is complete, we will purify and
        release your data back to the universe (or delete it, whichever comes
        first).
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">6. Third-Eye Parties</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Occasionally, we may share your data with third parties who align with
        our cosmic mission. These include, but are not limited to, our mystical
        payment processors, celestial email servers, and any beings who can help
        improve your AquaGastronomy experience. We do not sell your data to dark
        forces or evil corporations. Only entities with high vibrations are
        welcome here.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 mb-1 font-semibold">
        7. Children's Privacy in the Aquatic Realms
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        AquaGastronomy is not intended for guests under the age of 13. While
        children may drink water from physical sources, the spiritual waters we
        offer are far too potent for their young souls. If you are a parent or
        guardian, we kindly ask that you shield your little ones from our site
        until they are ready to embrace the true depths of water wisdom.
      </p>

        8. Your Rights in the Water Cycle
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        As a fellow traveler on this aqueous journey, you have rights when it
        comes to your personal data. You may request access, corrections, or the
        removal of your information from our digital wellspring at any time.

        9. Changes to Our Privacy Rituals
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        Just as rivers may shift their course, we may update our privacy
        practices from time to time. When this happens, we will notify you
        through the gentle whispers of the wind, or via email. By continuing
        your spiritual dining experience with us, you accept any changes made to
        this policy.
      </p>

        10. Contact Us through the Waters
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-300 max-w-[600px]">
        If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, your data, or
        the state of your hydration enlightenment, please feel free to contact
